# CNN Architecture

The code snippet demonstrates the use of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, specifically **VGG16**, from Keras’ `applications` module. VGG16 is a deep CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset, capable of recognizing a wide variety of image features. In this case, the model is loaded **without its fully connected top layers** (`include_top=False`), and the input shape is specified as **(224, 224, 3)**, which matches the expected input dimensions for VGG16 (a 224x224 RGB image). This configuration allows the network to be used as a **feature extractor**, useful in transfer learning tasks. The `.summary()` function displays the network’s architecture layer by layer, including **Conv2D** layers that extract visual features like edges and textures, and **MaxPooling2D** layers that reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, making computation more efficient and helping to focus on the most prominent features. This setup is often used as a backbone for image classification, object detection, or other computer vision tasks.


# CNN: Image Classification using MNIST

This code implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). The data is first loaded and preprocessed by reshaping the images to include a single channel and normalizing pixel values between 0 and 1. The labels are one-hot encoded using `to_categorical` for multi-class classification. The CNN architecture consists of two convolutional layers: the first with 32 filters and the second with 64 filters, both using 3x3 kernels and ReLU activation, each followed by a MaxPooling layer to reduce dimensionality and computation. The output is flattened and passed through a dense layer with 64 neurons and a final output layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation to predict the digit class. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss, which are ideal for multi-class classification tasks. Training is performed over 5 epochs with validation on the test set. This setup typically results in high accuracy and low loss, demonstrating the effectiveness of CNNs in image recognition tasks.
